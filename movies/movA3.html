    <h1 class="title">ParaNorman</h1>
    <p class="desc">
      ParaNorman is a 2012 American stop-motion animated comedy horror film
      directed by Sam Fell and Chris Butler (in his latter feature directorial
      debuts), and written by Butler.[4] Produced by Laika, the film stars the
      voices of Kodi Smit-McPhee, Jodelle Ferland, Bernard Hill, Tucker
      Albrizzi, Anna Kendrick, Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Leslie
      Mann, Jeff Garlin, Elaine Stritch, Tempestt Bledsoe, Alex Borstein, and
      John Goodman. It is the first stop-motion film to use a 3D color printer
      to create character faces, and only the second to be shot in 3D.[5] In the
      film, Norman, a young boy who can communicate with ghosts, is given the
      task of ending a 300-year-old witch's curse on his Massachusetts town.
      ParaNorman was officially released on August 17, 2012, by Focus
      Features.[6] It received generally positive reviews from critics, who
      praised its animation and humor,[7] and was a modest box office success,
      earning $107 million worldwide against its budget of $60 million.[3][8][9]
      The film was nominated for that year's Academy Award for Best Animated
      Feature and BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, but lost both to Pixar's
      Brave.
