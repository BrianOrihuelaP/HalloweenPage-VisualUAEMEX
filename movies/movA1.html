    <h1 class="title">Corpse Bride</h1>
    <p class="desc">
      Corpse Bride (also known as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride) is a 2005
      stop-motion animated musical dark fantasy film[4] directed by Mike Johnson
      and Tim Burton with a screenplay by John August, Caroline Thompson and
      Pamela Pettler based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel.
      The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era village in England. Johnny
      Depp leads the cast as the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter
      voices Emily, the titular bride. An international co-production between
      the United States and United Kingdom, Corpse Bride is the third
      stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him
      (the previous two films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the
      Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick). This is also the first
      stop-motion feature from Burton that was distributed by Warner Bros.
      Pictures. It was dedicated to executive producer Joe Ranft, who died in a
      car crash during production.
